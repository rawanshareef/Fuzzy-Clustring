# The Fuzzy Clustring
Fuzzy Clustering is a type of clustering algorithm in machine learning that allows a data point to belong to more than one cluster with different degrees of membership. 
Unlike traditional clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, which assign
each data point to a single cluster, fuzzy clustering assigns a membership degree between 0 and 1 for each data point for each cluster.
